- You're free to use any CSS approach, whatever you're comfortable with (create-react-app ships with [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) by default), such as [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/create-react-app) or [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/docs/basics#installation)
- Don't worry about using a backend, using state is enough for this exercise
